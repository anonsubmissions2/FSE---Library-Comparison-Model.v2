\section{Methodology}

Figure~\ref{fig:methodology} provides an overview of the overall research method which was applied to the study.

\section{Saturation}
\input{tables/concept-saturation-progress.tex}
Figure~\ref{fig:saturation} shows how the concepts were discussed during each interview. The number denote how many times a concept was discussed by one particular interview. The more a participant discussed about a particular concept, the more red the corresponding cell is. For example, library search and analysis process was most discussed by P5 and after their interview, subsequently we did not have much to discuss about the search process.  After P8, the concept almost saturated and we discussed very little about this concept with subsequent interviewees.

\section{Code System}

Figures~\ref{fig:process} and \ref{fig:conditions} show the relationship between major categories, categories, and concepts in the code system. These concepts and categories contribute to the conceptual framework of the software library adoption process.

\section{Guiding Principles}
In this section, we present the six full patterns associated with the library adoption steps.
