    \midrule
    1 & Wasserman et al. (2017): Developed an online tool for evaluating open source software (not library) \cite{wasserman2017osspal} & Software Evaluation Tool & The tool evaluates software based on quantitative data collected from source repository and qualitative review submitted to the tool's online portal. \\
    2 & Li et al. (2022): Interviewed 23 practitioners for finding evaluation factors for open source software (not library) \cite{li2022exploring} & Software Evaluation Tool & Identified 8 factors for software applications evaluation. Found that, 40 out of 74 sub-factors (under 8 factors) have related information available in the repositories. Performed fesibility of collecting quantiative information about those sub-factors from repositories.  \\
    3 & Uddin and Khomh (2017): Developed a tool 'Opiner' for summarizing opinions about APIs. \cite{uddin2017automatic}  & Opinion Summarization Technique & Investigated the statistical and aspect based summarization techniques. By conducting a user study on a summarization tool Opiner, found that the aspect based summaries helps developers better than other summarization. \\
    4 & Uddin and Khomh (2017): Crawled online forums for collecting API related opinions for the summarization tool 'Opiner' \cite{uddin2017opiner}  & Opinion Summarization Tool & Developed an API opinion summarization tool by crawling online forums contents regarding posts related with different APIs and their aspects. \\
    5 & de la Mora and Nadi (2018): Proposed library selection factors \cite{de2018library}  & Library Selection Factors & Proposed 9 quantitative metrics of libraries that can be used for comparing multiple libraries. \\
    6 & de la Mora and Nadi (2018): Developed an API comparison tool 'LibComp' \cite{de2018empirical}  & Library Data Collection Tool & The tool collects quantitative data from softwre repositories and question answer sites and conducted a user survey for the usefulness of the tool. \\
    7 & El-Hajj and Nadi (2020): Developed an IDE plugin for library comparison based on 'LibComp' \cite{el2020libcomp}  & Library Selection Factors IDE Plugin & The IDE plugin is based on a previous online tool to present metric based library selection factors. \\
    8 & Lin et al. (2019): Developed a opinion mining technique 'POME' \cite{lin2019pattern}  & Opinion Mining Technique & Developed a rule based pattern matching technique to mine aspects of online opinions regarding APIs or libraries and compared against 'Opiner'. \\
    9 & Uddin and Khomh (2021): Compared mining techniques against a benchmark dataset. \cite{uddin2019automatic}  & Opinion Mining Technique & Prepared and analyzed a benchmark dataset for API related online opinions and analyzed mining techniques using different classification methods for aspect detection. \\
    10 & Uddin and Khomh (2021): Compared sentiment analysis performance of different machine learning techniques. \cite{uddin2022empirical}  & Opinion Sentiment Analysis & Proposed an ensembled method using pretrained models for improved performance. \\
    \multicolumn{1}{p{.5em}}{11, 12, 13} & Huang et al. (2018), Wang et al (2020), Wang et al (2021): Developed a technology comparison tool DiffTech \cite{huang2018tell, wang2020difftech, wang2021difftech}  & Technology Comparison Factors Tool & The tool mines comparative opinions in Stack Overflow about pairs of technologies without any predefined selection factors. Preesnted detailed methodology and technique of DiffTech.. \\
    14 & Liu et al. (2021): Performed qualitative analysis of Stack Overflow posts for developers' API needs \cite{liu2021api}  & API Related Needs & Identified eight categories (non/functional improvement, alternative API, API comparison, error handling etc.) of developers' needs expressed in Stack Overflow. \\
    15 & Uddin et al. (2021): Conducted two surveys (176 participant) to understand developers' API related needs \cite{uddin2019understanding}  & Developer Survey on API opinions & and found that review summarization tools can help them frequently. The study also reported 10 most important library selection factors. \\
    16 & Yan et al. (2022):  Designed a user interface for library comparison \cite{yan2022concept}  & Library Comparison UI & The interactive user interface presents concept (aspect) annotated code examples side by side for comparing multiple libraries. \\
    17 & Spinellis (2019): Provided guideline for library selection factors \cite{spinellis2019select}  & Library Selection Factors & Presented 13 product and process related factors for selecting open source libraries or components \\
    18 & Larios-Vargas et al. (2020): Conducted interviews (16 participants) and survey (115 participants) to identifiy library selection factors \cite{larios2020selecting}  & Library Selection Factors & Conducted interviews (16 participant) and survey (115 participant) and identified 26 library selection technical, human, and economic factors. \\
