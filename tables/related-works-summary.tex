    Software Evaluation Tool & Open source software evaluation factors and tool \cite{wasserman2017osspal,
    li2022exploring} & Provides evaluation criteria (factors) for open source software (not library component). Identified 8 factors and 74 sub-factors. \\ 
    Technology Comparison Tool & \textbf{DiffTech:} technology comparison tool \cite{huang2018tell, wang2020difftech, wang2021difftech} & The tool mines comparative opinions in Stack Overflow about pairs of technologies without any predefined selection factors. \\ 
    \textbf{Library factors} related data & \textbf{LibComp:} Quantitative data collection on library specific factors \cite{de2018library, de2018empirical, el2020libcomp} & Proposed 9 quantitative factors of libraries and developed an online tool and an IDE plugin to display library specific information. \\ 
    \textbf{Library factors} related opinion & \textbf{Opiner:} Opinion summarization of library specific factors \cite{uddin2017automatic, uddin2017opiner} & Developed an API opinion summarization tool by crawling online forums contents regarding posts related with different APIs and their aspects. \\ 
    Opinion Mining Technique & Opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques \cite{lin2019pattern, uddin2019automatic, uddin2022empirical} & Prepared benchmark dataset for opinions, and proposed pattern based or machine learning based techniques. \\ 
    Library Related Needs & Developer needs identification from Stack Overflow \cite{liu2021api, uddin2019understanding} & Identified 8 API related needs expressed in Stack Overflow and reported library selection factors from developer survey. \\ 
    Library Comparison UI & User interface for library comparison \cite{yan2022concept} & The interactive user interface presents concept (aspect) annotated code examples side by side for comparing multiple libraries. \\ 
    \textbf{Library Factors} for selection criteria & Library selection factors \cite{spinellis2019select, larios2020selecting} & Presented library selection factors from experience and from practitioners' survey and interview. \\
