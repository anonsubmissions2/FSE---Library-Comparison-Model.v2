\begin{practice}{5}{Ensure Compliance}
\actor{Developers, Information Security Experts, Legal Experts, Open Source Program Office}
\condition{Matured, regulated org or industry (health, finance). Presence of dedicated security/legal experts.}
\concern{Any penalty or legal complication arising from using a library? How to protect the organization?}
\solution{Use a library which is compliant with the application security standards and legal requirements}
\consideration{License compatible with existing code and business. Secure, no known vulnerability.}
\steps{Reach out to specialists in the organization for taking their expert consent before adopting the library. See the license and security declarations in the library documentation in the source code or package repository.}
\consequence{Early stage companies may ignore compliance and can face existential crisis.}
\example{We had a very bad experience with this. With the legacy system, we were using so many different libraries and there is a licensing issue and we had to replace half of the library. Otherwise we had to pay lots of money. So that's why we are now very, very concerned about adding any external library, because if we don’t comply with the license, it will be a legal problem.}{P09}
